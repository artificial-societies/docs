## Overview

Artificial Societies is designed for anyone who writes and produces content to experiment with their messages and ideas before putting them out in reality.

The core concept is simple: write a draft of your message, and run a simulation to have thousands of AI personas interact and respond to the content.

This gives you the courage to be creative, and the confidence to put your message out into the world.
