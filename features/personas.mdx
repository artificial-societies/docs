### Personas FAQ

<Accordion title="Where does the data come from?">
    Each persona is built from real data about an actual person. We gather information from publicly available social media profiles and web searches to create authentic representations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How are personas created?">
    We analyze all available data about each person to build personas with beliefs, preferences, and behaviors that accurately reflect their real profile. These personas adapt their behavior to different contexts, just like how real people communicate differently on LinkedIn versus X versus email. We capture these contextual variations in our personas.

<Accordion title="What about characteristics that aren't publicly visible?">
    Our data allows us to infer many audience characteristics, such as political beliefs and opinions. However, when you create a target society requiring specific attributes that aren't easily observable - like being 
    interested in life insurance or owning a Tesla - we can add these characteristics to personas within your audience.

<Accordion title="Why chat to a persona?">
