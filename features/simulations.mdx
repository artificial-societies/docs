## What are Simulations?

Simulations allow you to run controlled experiments with your artificial societies to observe behaviors, test hypotheses, and analyze outcomes. Each simulation creates a virtual environment where your personas interact according to defined rules and parameters.

## Creating a Simulation

To set up a new simulation, you need to configure several key components:

### Basic Setup
- **Name**: Descriptive name for your simulation
- **Society**: Which society to use for the experiment
- **Duration**: How long the simulation should run
- **Scenario**: What situation or context to simulate

### Parameters
- **Environment**: The setting and conditions for the simulation
- **Events**: Specific triggers or situations to introduce
- **Metrics**: What data to collect and analyze

## Simulation Types

### Communication Simulations
Test how information flows through your society and how personas respond to messages.

### Decision-Making Simulations
Observe how groups make decisions and reach consensus on various topics.

### Crisis Response Simulations
Test how societies handle unexpected events or challenges.

### Social Network Simulations
Study how relationships and connections evolve over time.

## Running Simulations

### Starting a Simulation
```javascript
// Create and start a new simulation
const simulation = new Simulation({
  society: 'tech-startup',
  duration: '7 days',
  scenario: 'product-launch'
});

simulation.start();
```

### Monitoring Progress
```javascript
// Check simulation status
simulation.getStatus();

// Get real-time metrics
simulation.getMetrics();
```

### Pausing and Resuming
```javascript
// Pause simulation
simulation.pause();

// Resume simulation
simulation.resume();
```

## Example Simulation Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "Product Launch Crisis",
  "society": "tech-startup",
  "duration": "5 days",
  "scenario": {
    "type": "crisis-response",
    "trigger": "server-outage",
    "severity": "high"
  },
  "metrics": [
    "response-time",
    "communication-frequency",
    "decision-quality",
    "stress-levels"
  ],
  "events": [
    {
      "day": 2,
      "event": "customer-complaints",
      "intensity": "medium"
    },
    {
      "day": 3,
      "event": "press-inquiry",
      "intensity": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Analyzing Results

### Data Collection
Simulations automatically collect data on:
- Communication patterns
- Decision-making processes
- Response times
- Stress levels
- Network changes

### Visualization
View results through:
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Timeline visualizations
- Network diagrams
- Statistical analysis

### Export Options
```javascript
// Export simulation results
simulation.exportResults({
  format: 'json',
  includeMetrics: true,
  includeTimeline: true
});
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Start with short simulations (1-3 days) to validate your setup before running longer experiments.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Complex simulations with many personas and events can be resource-intensive. Monitor system performance during execution.
</Warning>

### Simulation Design Tips
- Define clear objectives before starting
- Use realistic scenarios and parameters
- Include control groups when possible
- Document your assumptions and methodology
- Run multiple iterations to ensure reliability

## Advanced Features

### Custom Events
Create custom events to test specific scenarios:
```javascript
simulation.addCustomEvent({
  trigger: 'user-defined-condition',
  action: 'custom-response',
  parameters: { /* custom data */ }
});
```

### A/B Testing
Compare different configurations:
```javascript
// Run simulation with configuration A
const resultA = simulation.run(configA);

// Run simulation with configuration B  
const resultB = simulation.run(configB);

// Compare results
simulation.compareResults(resultA, resultB);
```
