## What are Societies?

Societies are collections of personas that interact with each other in your experiments. Each society can have its own rules, behaviors, and communication patterns.

## Creating a Society

To create a new society, you need to define:

### Basic Information
- **Name**: A descriptive name for your society
- **Description**: What this society represents or simulates
- **Size**: Number of personas in the society

### Configuration
- **Communication Rules**: How personas interact with each other
- **Behavior Patterns**: Common actions and responses
- **Network Structure**: How personas are connected

## Society Types

### Small Groups (2-10 personas)
Perfect for focused experiments and detailed interactions.

### Medium Communities (10-50 personas)
Good for testing social dynamics and group behaviors.

### Large Populations (50+ personas)
Ideal for studying emergent behaviors and complex social patterns.

## Managing Societies

### Adding Personas
```javascript
// Add a persona to an existing society
society.addPersona(personaId);
```

### Removing Personas
```javascript
// Remove a persona from a society
society.removePersona(personaId);
```

### Updating Rules
```javascript
// Update communication rules
society.updateRules({
  communicationStyle: 'formal',
  interactionFrequency: 'daily'
});
```

## Example Society Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "Tech Startup",
  "description": "A small tech company with diverse roles",
  "size": 8,
  "rules": {
    "communicationStyle": "collaborative",
    "hierarchy": "flat",
    "meetingFrequency": "weekly"
  },
  "personas": [
    "founder",
    "engineer",
    "designer",
    "marketer",
    "sales",
    "support",
    "product-manager",
    "analyst"
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Start with smaller societies (5-10 personas) to understand the dynamics before scaling up to larger populations.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Large societies can become computationally intensive. Monitor performance when working with 100+ personas.
</Warning>
