Societies are networks of personas. Once you have configured a society, you can use it to run simulations.

### Societies FAQ

#### Types of Society

<Accordion title="What are Personal Societies?">
    Personal societies are based off your own social media. The networks place you at the centre and those closest to you are those who you share the most engagement with. For LinkedIn accounts, we base your society off of who interacts with you and who you interact with in return. For X, we base your society off of your followers. This process also creates your author profile and tone of voice.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are Target Societies?">
    When you describe your target society, we take that description and run it through our database of over 500,000 personas. We retrieve all the matches and rank them by suitability. When we need more personas, we search the web for profiles that fit and add them too.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why are Personas in Target Societies Anonymous?">
    Because our data is based on real people, we do not want to readily disclose the identities of people who are included in a target society. This is the same as how survey takers have anonymised data to protect their identity.
</Accordion>

#### Creating Societies

<Accordion title="What Makes a Good Description?">
    Descriptions can be as brief or as detailed as you like. What’s most important is that you capture all of the key elements of the people you want in your society. Good descriptions often include attributes like an age range, location, and professional industry. If you want to see specific subgroups in your society (the different colours on the network), you can designate these as segments.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are Segments?">
    Segments are a way of categorising personas as part of one group or another. They appear as different colours on the network graph. When you have the results of a simulation, you can click on different segments to see how the breakdown of the scores changes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to Edit a Society?">
    On the Societies Homepage, you can click the three dots in the top right corner to bring up a menu. This allows you to refresh and delete societies. Segments are automatically generated but you can edit them in the societies homepage.
</Accordion>

#### Navigating the Network
<Accordion title="How is the Network Arranged?">
    The network is an interactive representation of every persona in your society. Every dot is an individual, and the lines between them indicate social connections. The network is arranged so that personas are generally situated closer to those they are more closely related with.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How Can I Interract with the Personas?">
    You can interact with personas by clicking on the dots. This brings up more details about them, gives you an opportunity to chat, and see how they reacted to your content or message.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why are Some Dots Larger?">
    Larger dots are people with larger social media followings. They tend to be more socially connected and have a large degree of social influence.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What do the Different Colours Mean?">
    When you first open a network, the colours indicate the different segments in your society. Once your results have been generated, by clicking on the “Attention” and “Action” sections, you can see the whole network.
</Accordion>

#### Understanding Segments
<Accordion title="How are they created?">
    When your society is first created, we break down your audience into different subgroups. These are displayed as different colours in the network.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I edit segments?">
    Go to the societies homepage, and click on the 3 dots at the top right corner of a society tile to open the menu. Click edit and off you go.
