Results show you how your artificial societies responded to your content. Use these insights to spot patterns, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve your posts.

## Types of Results

### Impact Score

<Frame>

</Frame>
<br />

The impact score measures both **attention** and **engagement**. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better performance.

- **Exceptional:** Scores above 85
- **Very High:** Scores above 75
- **High:** Scores above 65
- **Average:** Scores above 45
- **Low:** Scores above 25
- **Very Low:** Scores below 25

Achieving **Very High** or **Exceptional** scores is rare - if your content reaches these levels, it‚Äôs a strong indicator that your message is ready to perform well when posted.

#### Attention
Attention shows how much time each persona spent with your content:
- **Ignore:** Dismissed immediately
- **Partial:** Skimmed or left early
- **Full:** Engaged with entire message

<Tip>
**Click the Attention section** to see individual persona responses. Chat with personas who ignored or partially engaged to understand why.
</Tip>

#### Engagement

For social media posts in your personal societies, you‚Äôll see a predicted range for how many reactions your post is likely to receive. We show an average prediction, along with upper and lower bounds that capture where your post‚Äôs performance is expected to fall about 80% of the time.

Engagement predictions are only available for personal societies, since these are based on your real social media audiences.

<Accordion title="How do I get higher scores?">
    To boost your scores, experiment with different content variants and observe which ones resonate best with your society. Incorporate successful elements from high-performing drafts into future posts.

### Variants

<Frame>

</Frame>
<br />

Each time you test a piece of content, Artificial Societies automatically generates 10 alternative versions - called variants - and tests them alongside your original draft. You‚Äôll see the results for the top 3 variants, making it easy to compare performance.

Each variant is crafted using your unique **tone of voice** and **proven writing styles** tailored to the content type.

<Accordion title="How do you capture my tone of voice?">
    We analyze your previous LinkedIn and X posts to extract your personal style and communication patterns.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How should I use variants?">
    Use variants as inspiration or adopt them directly. Many users blend elements from high-performing variants into their drafts, then run new simulations to keep improving.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I make variants sound more like me?">
    Click on any variant and give thumbs-up or thumbs-down feedback. The more feedback you provide, the better we can match your preferred style.
</Accordion>

### Insights

Insights provide a clear overview of your simulation results. Our engine analyzes your message, society, and outcomes to highlight key takeaways - helping you quickly understand what worked, what didn't, and where to focus next.

<Tip>
To explore your results in more detail, click **‚ÄúAsk a Follow-up‚Äù** to chat with **Amos**. Just like speaking with a market research expert, you can ask Amos for deeper analysis‚Äîsuch as which personas responded best or worst, why certain reactions occurred, and how you can improve your content.

### Conversations

**Sentiment indicators:**
- üü¢ Green: Positive
- ‚ö™ Grey: Neutral
