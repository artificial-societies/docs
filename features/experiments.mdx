Simulations let you test your ideas and messages in a safe environment before sharing them with the real world.

When you run a simulation, your message is introduced to the society. The personas interact, respond, and influence each other just as they would in real communities, allowing you to observe reactions, uncover insights, and refine your approach with confidence.

## Running Simulations

<Steps>
    <Step title="Choose a content type">

<Frame>    
    ![Content Types](/images/contexts.png)
</Frame>
<br />

    When you click **create new test**, the **content types** menu will appear. The content type determines how your message reaches the personas in the society. It also informs the kinds of actions the personas can take, and the way the variants are written.
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Write your message">
<Frame>    
    ![Draft a Message](/images/draft.png)
</Frame>
<br />    

    After choosing your content type, draft the message you want to test. For example, if you're simulating a LinkedIn post, write the post as you would normally share it.
    
    <Tip>
    Unlike a chatbot, where you might ask a question, here you’re crafting the actual content to be evaluated by the personas.
    </Tip>

    **Upload an image or PDF**
<br />

    You can upload an image or PDF by clicking the **upload** button. Anything that you upload will be presented to the personas alongside your message. In some cases, you may want to leave the message blank and just upload an image, for example when testing a website homepage.
    
    **Help Me Craft**

    Need inspiration for your content? **Amos**, our social intelligence engine, can help you brainstorm ideas and generate a first draft tailored to your audience, author profile, and chosen content type. Simply ask Amos for suggestions, or upload an image or PDF — Amos will use what you provide as inspiration to craft a relevant draft for your simulation.
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Run the Simulation">

<br />

    Click **simulate** to start the experiment. We introduce your message to every AI persona and **run thousands of LLM calls** to simulate realistic social dynamics and interactions between personas.

## Simulations FAQ

<Accordion title="How do I run A/B tests?">
    You can easily run A/B tests with as many variations as you like with Artificial Societies. To test different versions of your message, click **create new test** for each variant you want to simulate. There’s no limit to the number of alternatives you can compare, so you can explore as many options as you need to find what resonates best with your society.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long do simulations take to run?">
Simulation duration depends on the size of your message and whether you have included any attachments. Short messages with no attachments typically complete in 30 seconds to a minute, while larger messages may take up to 5 minutes.

If you feel like your simulation has become stuck, copy your draft and hit refresh to see if your result has arrived.

<Accordion title="How accurate are the simulation results?">
Our simulations use advanced AI models trained on real social media data and behavioral patterns. While no simulation can perfectly predict real-world outcomes, our results have shown strong correlation with actual engagement rates and user responses.
